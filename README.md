# RegexLFA

It is an application written in JavaScript, Html and Css with the aim of familiarizing myself with formal and automatic languages.
The application is divided into 2 pages, theme 1, theme 2.
Theme 1: check if a string respects a pattern.
Task 2: Extract a substring from the source string based on a pattern.
